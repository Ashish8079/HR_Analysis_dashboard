üì£ Objective: To identify the key factors why employees are leaving the company and to present the findings through visualization.

üóù Key Findings:

‚Ä¢ The age group of 26-35 has the highest number of employees who are leaving the company, with 116 employees. These employees are mostly single, as the donut chart shows that 51% of the employees who are leaving are unmarried.

‚Ä¢ The job roles of laboratory technicians and sales executives have the most employee turnover, compared to other job roles. The education field of life sciences and medical also has a high attrition rate among employees.

‚Ä¢ Employees who earn less than 5K, which is below the monthly average salary, are more likely to leave their job. These employees are also young and inexperienced.

‚Ä¢ Employees who leave the company early, within two years of work, do not receive any salary hike.

üìÑ Recommendations:

‚Ä¢ The company should focus on retaining the employees in the age group of 26-35 and offer them competitive salaries.

‚Ä¢ The company should also provide more training and development opportunities for laboratory technicians and sales executives, as well as employees with education in life sciences and medical.
